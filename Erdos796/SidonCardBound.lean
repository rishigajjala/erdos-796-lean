# A factor-graph cardinal bound for multiplicative Sidon sets

This file packages the two `C₄`-free graph counts in the explicit upper-bound
argument.  The number-theoretic part of that argument chooses one of two
factorizations for every element.  `SidonFactorCover` records exactly the
properties of those choices which enter the graph count; the theorem
`card_sub_one_sub_primeCounting_le_of_factorCover` then proves the cardinal
estimate without hiding any further compatibility assertion.
