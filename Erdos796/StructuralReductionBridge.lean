# Converting a uniform finite upper bound into structural reduction

Once every admissible set is bounded by `G(n)` plus a uniform error whose
ratio to `n/log n` tends to zero, the structural reduction follows by a
direct squeeze argument.  This module isolates that final analytic wrapper
from the combinatorial pruning proof.
