# The finite certificate for Erdős Problem 796

This file formalizes the seven cofactor fibers and the multiplication
certificate in Section 6 and Appendix A of the accompanying manuscript.

The convolution is *ordered*: `(u, v)` and `(v, u)` are different witnesses
when both occur.  Thus the bound `≤ 2` below is exactly the compatibility
condition used in the manuscript, including for a fiber paired with itself.
